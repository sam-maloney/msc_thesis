Create new solver modifying solver icoFoam. Copy solver icoFoam e.g. to directory applications/solvers in your work directory: # cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR 
# mkdir applications 
# cd applications 
# mkdir solvers 
# cd solvers 
# cp -r $FOAM_APP/solvers/incompressible/icoFoam/ ./

Rename copied solver e.g.: 
# mv icoFoam icoTempFoam 

Rename source file icoFoam.C Replace word icoFoam with word icoTempFoam everywhere in source code Replace words also in files in directory Make:
# cd icoTempFoam 
# mv icoFoam.C icoTempFoam.C 
# sed -i 's/icoFoam/icoTempFoam/g' Make/files 
# sed -i 's/icoFoam/icoTempFoam/g' icoTempFoam.C

In file files change binary file path from $FOAM_APPBIN to $FOAM_USER_APPBIN Remove useless files:
# rm icoFoam.dep

Compile solver before doing any changes to make sure it is prepared for implementation: 
# wmake
