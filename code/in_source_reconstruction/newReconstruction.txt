Steps for creating a new "well-balanced" reconstruction scheme in foam-extend:ls 

done 1. Create a new limiter class balancedPotentialLimiter
done    Source should be located in src/dbns/limiter
done    This is just a dummy class to use for template specializtion of numericFlux
done    Simply inherit from firstOrderLimiter
done    Add symlink to header in src/dbns/lnInclude using absolute path-to-file

done 2. Add new limiter to runtime selection table
done    Add to macro makeBasicNumericFluxForAllLimiters in numericFluxes.C
done    Need to include the header file in the following sources:
done      src/dbns/limiter/MDLimiter.H
done      src/dbns/numericFlux/numericFluxes.C

done 3. Create a partial specialization of the numericFlux class
done    Template class Limiter should now be specialized to balancedPotentialLimiter
done    Use source files balancedNumericFlux.[CH] and #include in the regular files
done    Contains an additional member for the external potential field

done 4. Overload the Foam::basicNumericFlux::New(...) function
done    The overload will also take the potential field as an input
done    Need to add overloaded prototype to basicNumericFlux.H file as well
done    Based on the Limiter dictionary value, will select correct numericFlux class
done    Change specialized numericFlux constructor to take potential
done    Regular numericFlux constructor must also take (and ignore) a potential

done 5. In the specialized numericFlux class, rewrite the computeFlux() member
done    Compute Bernoulli constant at cell centres
done    Interpolate potential at the cell faces
done    Compute rho at the cell face using Newton's Method
done    Directly compute remaining variables and pass to evaluateFlux(...)
