Well-balanced methods for computation of the standing accretion shock 
instability (SASI)


Abstract
--------
In astrophysics, accretion shocks are fairly commonly encountered, and in 
particular, standing accretion shocks (SAS) are part of the theory behind 
core-collapse supernovae. An instability (SASI) has been proposed as a 
possible mechanism for driving their explosive evolution, as the spherical 
system could trap perturbation effects in the interior subsonic region.

For this thesis, a well-balanced method for simulating steady states in the 
presence of external potential fields, developed by R. KÃ¤ppeli and S. Mishra, 
was extended to non-hydrostatic equilibria. This code was then used to 
simulate a simplified model problem set-up for the SAS to study the 
interaction of perturbations within the system. The model set-up includes the 
stationary shock front along with an interior decelerating potential step 
which is intended to model the effects of matter settling onto the surface of 
the accreting object. These simulations show evidence for a coupled 
advective-acoustic cycle within the interior region.
