Well-balanced schemes are developed for the computation of stationary flows for the Euler equations in the presence of an external potential. The new schemes maintain a discrete equilibrium to machine precision and are applicable across a large class of such equilibria, including both hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic cases. Fundamental to the new method is a local equilibrium reconstruction, using iterative solutions to tie variation in the primitive values to variation in the external potential. The resultant flux and source term discretizations are well-balanced for any choice of consistent numerical flux function. Equations of state beyond the ideal gas law are compatible with the new scheme, which is necessary for many astrophysical problems of interest. Its extension to use on unstructured tetrahedral meshes is also demonstrated, a first for such well-balanced schemes and important for problems involving complex geometry not amenable to structured meshes. Application of the new scheme to a model problem for the standing accretion shock instability is carried out, and evidence for the advective-acoustic cycle---the coupling of vorticity and pressure waves at the shock and as the flow decelerates through a potential step---is observed. The new scheme greatly improves the accuracy of the solutions at the potential step as the underlying equilibrium is precisely maintained throughout the simulation.
